# MECH5030_Machine_Learning_MATLAB
*The following repository is for the use of a University of Leeds project within MECH5030 2020-2021.*

The project uses data collected from an Arduino with IMU Sensors to gather data wirelessly using BLE.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the "AITrainTestPipeline.mlx" there are a series of Matlab toolboxes that must be installed. If you attempt to run you may receive an message saying which toolboxes you are missing. A list of toolboxes installed are provided below: 

<ul>
<li>Simulink - Version 10.3
<li>Deep Learning Toolbox - Version 14.2
<li>Mapping Toolbox - Version 5.1
<li>Sensor Fusion and Tracking Toolbox - Version 2.1
<li>Signal Processing Toolbox - Version 8.6
<li>Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox - Version 12.1
</ul>

### Installing

To install the required libraries into Matlab there is one main method.

**1. Using Matlabs's Library Manager**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Apps -> Get More Apps... With the library manager open simply search for desired library and then click the install button.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Note:** If asked to install additional libraries it is advised to choose YES otherwise the installed library may not work as it should.
